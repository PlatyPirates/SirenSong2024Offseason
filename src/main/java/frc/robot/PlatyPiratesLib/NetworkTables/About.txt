NTInt, NTDouble, NTString,

We use NetworkTables to report values to any other processors (eg. Raspberry Pi). Writing all of the topics
and publishers is tedious and takes up a lot of space in the code, so we created some super simple values
that do all of the topics and publishing behind the scenes so that we can shorten code to initialize a value
that will be published to NetworkTables from this:

int robotSpeed;
DoubleTopic speed = ntinst.getDoubleTopic("/datatable/Speed");
final DoublePublisher speedPub = speed.publish();
speed.setDefault(0.0);
speed.set(robotSpeed);

to this:

NTDouble speed = new NTDouble(0.0,"Speed");

Much shorter! üëç
